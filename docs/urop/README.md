# UROP Resources

The UCI [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program](https://urop.uci.edu/)
makes is possible for undergraduate students to participate in research and
provides grants to support UCI faculty-mentored research projects and creative
activities. Since the URL is a research organization, **we make it mandatory for
all URL projects to apply for UROP funding**.

There are various different UROP opportunities, but the one we're currently
focusing on is the
[Research Experience Fellowship](#research-experience-fellowship-ref).

## Research Experience Fellowship (REF)

According to the [UROP website](https://urop.uci.edu/urop-opportunities/):

> The Research Experience Fellowship (REF) provides recognition and possible
> funding for faculty mentored research and creative activity project related
> expenses. Funded awards are intended as reimbursement for project supplies and
> expenses. Undergraduate students may request up to $1,000 maximum for
> individual projects, and $2,500 maximum for group projects. Average funded
> awards typically range from $250-$400 for individual projects and $600-$1,000
> for group projects. These awards are for research being carried out by current
> UCI students for up to one year (fall 2024 through summer 2025), or until
> graduation, whichever comes first. Students who do not need funding may apply
> for non-funded recognition. UROP Fellows who are enrolled at UCI in spring
> quarter 2025 are required to present their project at the UCI Undergraduate
> Research Symposium in May 2025.

You can find our resources in our [UROP REF Resources page](/docs/urop/ref/).
