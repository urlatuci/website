# URL Branding Guidelines

## Logos

There's three aspects to the URL logo identity: the **text logo**, the **Flask
logo**, and the **Peter logo**.

### Text Logo

The text logo is just text that says "URL" on top of "Undergraduate Research
Lab". We decided to add both of these since we commonly just refer to ourselves
as the URL instead of the full name.

The entire logo is made with the Inter font. "URL" is bold with size 200 while
the "Undergraduate Research Lab" is regular with size 50.

### Flask Logo

The Flask logo was designed by Hailey Schaffer in 2024. This logo includes a
scientific flask on top of books and various papers. The flask, books, and
papers are meant to represent STEM research, non-STEM research, and the messy
process that is research respectively.

### Peter Logo

The Peter logo  was also designed by Hailey Schaffer in 2024. This logo is an
anteater wearing a lab coat with glasses. He is meant to represent the
University of California, Irvine's school mascot, Peter the Anteater.
