# URL Proposal Guidelines

Want to pursue your research ambitions? You can submit a proposal to the
Undergraduate Research Lab for the opportunity to lead a research project! This
document is here to help you write a great proposal.

Your next adventure starts here!

## URL Project Requirements

Before you start writing your proposal, please make sure that you are willing to
follow these rules:

- **Project Lead (PL)**: Projects must have a Project Lead. PLs must be available to
  talk with the URL Board to report their project's progress.
- **Room Reservation**: PLs must reserve the room on Google Calendar *before*
  going to the room.
- **Project Size**: A project must have at least 3 members at all times.
  If a project does not have enough members, they will be given a deadline to
  find more members. You may still apply, even if you have less than 3 members.
- **Timelines**: Projects must keep a timeline/agenda for their work. It must be
  updated as much as possible, and the URL Board must be given access to the
  timeline for progress reports.
- **Progress Reports & Meetings w/ Board**: The Board will conduct bi-weekly
  meetings with projects. The PLs must attend these meetings.
- **UROP Funding**: [Projects must apply for UROP funding.](/docs/urop/)
- **Documentation/Website**: Projects should ensure their work is properly
  documented. "Properly documented" is decided on a case-by-case basis; however,
  it must include the history of your project.

## Writing a Proposal

Your proposal will be written in
[this Google Form](https://forms.gle/LGNjZSB185N2wtt59). This section will
explain each individual part of your proposal.

### Abstract

You must provide a general overview of the project itself. It doesn't have to
be too complicated, just a single paragraph summarizing the project itself.

### Introduction

#### Problem

What is the problem this project is trying to solve? Add a paragraph that
explains what *why* the research is needed.

#### Solution

How is this project solving the problem? Add a paragraph that explains how your
solution aims to tackle the problem written above.

### Technicality

#### Benefits

What are the benefits of taking on this project?

#### Method of Approach

How are you going to begin your project? Literature review? Interviews? Python?
Etc.

### Management

#### Team

:::important

All projects must have at least THREE (3) students. You can apply with less than
3 students; however, you will be given a deadline to find more students willing
to participate.

:::

List the team members of the project, as well as the following information:

- Names
- Emails

#### Schedule/Timeline

Provide a rough timeline for the entire quarter.

### References (Optional)

If you included references in your proposal, please add them here!

## Samples

This section will include what would be a proposal for the
[Ojos Project](https://ojosproject.org/).

### Sample Abstract

### Sample Introduction

#### Sample Problem

> *When a family member is placed on hospice care, it can be a very troubling
> time for everybody. The entire family wants to help, but with various
> caregivers being involved, it can be difficult to efficiently keep track of a
> patient's care due to stress. This can be very dangerous if we're handling
> sensitive information, such as whether or not a patient took their medications
> or not. There may be different things you want all caregivers to know, but
> you're still trying to process everything that's happening. It's normal, and
> it happens to everybody.*

#### Sample Solution

> *I propose creating a tablet-like kiosk that would help keep track of a
> hospice patient's care. This device would be an all-in-one device for hospice
> care. It would keep track of medications, care instructions, as well as record
> the patient while you're away to ensure they're getting proper care. This
> device would also come with accessibility features to enhance a patient's
> independence.*
>
> *An important aspect of this research would relaying the information given to
> the device to all the caregivers' mobile devices. For example, once a
> medication has been logged, the device would send a text message to all
> caregivers so that everybody knows that the patient has taken their
> medication, ensuring that everybody is on the same page.*

### Sample Technicality

#### Sample Benefits

> *The benefits of this research would include: improving a patient's EOL care,
> increasing their independence, and help caregivers provide the best possible
> care for their loved one.*

#### Sample Method of Approach

> *There would be two aspects to this research: a programming aspect and an
> engineering aspect.*
>
> *On the programming side, we would create a desktop application that would
> handle the data-keeping aspect of the device. It would be created using web
> technologies such as React and Tauri.*
>
> *On the engineering side, we would research healthcare-appropriate material and
> create 3D models to make the device as useful and accessible as possible. Some
> of our current ideas include communication with a joystick.*

## Accepting Proposals

How the URL accepts proposals will be at the discretion of the board. A rubric
will be provided on this page soon.
