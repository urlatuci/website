## Rules for URL Projects

Projects in the URL must abide by the following rules:

- **Project Lead**: Projects must have a Project Lead. PLs must be available to
  talk with the URL Board to report their project's progress.
- **Keys and Room Reservation**: PLs will be given key access to the URL room.
  they must reserve the room on Google Calendar *before* going to the room.
- **Project Membership**: A project must have at least 3 members at all times.
  If a project does not have enough members, they will be given a deadline to
  find more members.
- **Timelines**: Projects must keep a timeline/agenda for their work. It must be
  updated as much as possible, and the URL Board must be given access to the
  timeline for progress reports.

  meetings with project teams. The PLs must attend these meetings.
- **UROP Funding**: Projects must apply for UROP funding.
- **Documentation/Website**: Projects should ensure their work is properly
  documented. "Properly documented" is decided on a case-by-case basis; however,
  it must include the history of your project.
